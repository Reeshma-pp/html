    <h3>Chat GPT</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022.<br>Based on large language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, <br>, style, level of detail, and language.Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.<br>
        ChatGPT is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and<br> public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[4] By January 2023, it had become what was then the <br>fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's <br> current valuation of $86 billion.[5][6] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, <br>including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[7] Microsoft launched Copilot, <br> initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In June 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. <br> and OpenAI was announced in which ChatGPT is integrated into the Apple Intelligence <br> feature of Apple operating systems.[8] Some observers raised concern about the potential <br> of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.
