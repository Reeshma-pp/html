    <h1>MONITOR</h1>
    <p>A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form.<br> A discrete monitor comprises a visual display, support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors,<br>and external user controls.

        The display in modern monitors is typically an LCD with LED backlight, <br>having by the 2010s replaced CCFL backlit LCDs. Before the mid-2000s, most monitors used a cathode-ray tube (CRT) as the image output technology.<br> A monitor is typically connected to its host computer via DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C, DVI, or VGA. Monitors sometimes use other proprietary connectors and signals to <br>connect to a computer, which is less common.
        
        Originally computer monitors were used for data processing while television <br>sets were used for video. From the 1980s onward, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and video,<br> while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. In the 2000s, the typical display aspect ratio of both televisions and computer monitors changed from 4:3 to 16:9.[2][3]
        
        Modern computer monitors are often functionally interchangeable with television sets <br>and vice versa. As most computer monitors do not include integrated speakers, TV tuners, <br>or remote controls, external components such as a DTA box may be needed to use a computer monitor as a TV set.[4][5]</p>
