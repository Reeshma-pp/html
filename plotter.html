    <h1>PLOTTER</h1>
    <p>A plotter is a machine that produces vector graphics drawings. Plotters draw lines on paper using a pen, <br>or in some applications, use a knife to cut a material like vinyl or leather. In the latter case, they are sometimes known as a cutting plotter.<br>

        In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, <br>as they were able to produce line drawings much faster and of a higher quality than contemporary conventional printers. <br>Smaller desktop plotters were often used for business graphics. Printers with graphics capabilities took away some of the market by the early 1980s, <br>and the introduction of laser printers in the mid-1980s largely eliminated the use of plotters from most roles.</p>
