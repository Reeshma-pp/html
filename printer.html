    <h1>PRINTER</h1>
    <p>The first computer printer designed was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century;<br> however, his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.[4]

        The first patented printing mechanism for applying a marking medium to a recording medium or more particularly an electrostatic inking apparatus <br>and a method for electrostatically depositing ink on controlled areas of a receiving medium, was in 1962 by C. R. Winston, Teletype Corporation, using continuous inkjet printing. <br>The ink was a red stamp-pad ink manufactured by Phillips Process Company of Rochester, NY under the name Clear Print. This patent (US3060429) led to the Teletype Inktronic Printer product<br>delivered to customers in late 1966.[5]
        
        The first compact, lightweight digital printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson <br>and released in 1968, according to Epson.[6][7][8]
        
        The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms <br>from electric typewriters and Teletype machines. The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use. <br>In the 1980s there were daisy wheel systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and dot-matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output. <br>The plotter was used for those requiring high-quality line art like blueprints.</p>
