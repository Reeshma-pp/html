    <h1>SCANNER</h1>
    <p>
        An image scanner (often abbreviated to just scanner) is a device that optically scans images, printed text, handwriting, or an object and converts it to a digital image. <br>The most common type of scanner used in offices and in the home is the flatbed scanner, where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. <br>A sheetfed scanner, which moves the page across an image sensor using a series of rollers, may be used to scan one document at a time or multiple,<br> as in an automatic document feeder. A handheld scanner is a portable version of an image scanner that can be used on any flat surface. Scans are usually downloaded to the computer <br>that the scanner is connected to, although some scanners are able to store scans on standalone flash media (e.g. memory cards and USB drives).

Modern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, <br>use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. Document cameras, which use commodity or specialized high-resolution cameras, photograph documents all at once.
